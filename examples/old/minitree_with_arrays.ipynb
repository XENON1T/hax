    "# Example Usage of Minitree Containing Array Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how to include arrays (of e.g. peak- or event-level data) in your minitree. It grabs some information about the largest N peaks from each event and stores it in array-type fields in the dataframe. Note that array fields are already supported with pickling (i.e. if you use the `hax.init` option `preferred_minitree_format='pklz'`)."

The keys of the dictionary become the branch names, and its values become the branch values. After turning on `uses_arrays` in your TreeMaker, you can have dictionary keys which contain arrays. Here I am saving several fields from the largest five peaks in the TPC that are not 'lone_hit's as arrays.\n",
